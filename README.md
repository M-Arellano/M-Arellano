- 👋 Hi, I’m Manuel Arellano from San Diego. Currently living in Grand Rapids, MI.
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Web Development. I've been using HTML and CSS for a few years, but now I am looking to expand my skillset into object oriented programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where my skills would be useful while I grow as a developer.
